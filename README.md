# Fraud-Detection-in-Banking-Transactions-Using-SQL
Detecting Financial Fraud with SQL
---
Detecting fraudulent banking transactions using SQL techniques such as CTEs, subqueries, and pattern recognition. By analyzing real-world financial transaction data, we aim to identify suspicious activities such as:

- Frequent High-Value Transactions: Customers making multiple large transactions in a short time frame.

- Duplicate Transactions: Multiple transactions with identical amounts, timestamps, and recipients.

- Unusual Withdrawals: Withdrawals at odd hours or from different locations in a short period.

The goal is to build a structured SQL-based fraud detection system that can be integrated into financial security frameworks, helping banks and financial institutions prevent unauthorized transactions and mitigate risks.
